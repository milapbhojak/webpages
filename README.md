WebPages - incredibly ***new*** python web framework
=======

I think, that most of web frameworks was inspired by Ruby on Rails approach.
I like RoR, Django, Cake PHP - these are good projects.
I have a new idea how to do programming more easy.


Foreword

I was thinking about how to teach my nephew to create web applications. The boy had 14 years old, and his was't learned programming before.

My goal was to tell about how to write web applications on python. But I was found that I need to tell a lot of basic information about:
 - hirst of all - help to install Ubuntu Linux to his PC
 - basic concepts of python language (this is not hard)
 - what is django, and how to create new empty project
 - how to change setings.py and run project
  - what is regular expressions (to build urls.py)
  - how to enable admin app and show admin site
 - how to **create new app**
  - describe models
  - design urls.py
  - add new app to **INSTALLED_APPS** in settings.py
 - what is html, css, java srcipt


Idea
--------

I think, that **urls.py not need** for us. We can design urls automatically with
